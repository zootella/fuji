ok, here's my current draft of this new file
you can see that below in the templat ei have two sections
the first is what was here before, a guide that matches neighboring experiments that i want to keep close to
the second is your draft of what the template should be for panning

for this example, let's make the tabletop 2500x2500
in the center, let's do make a canvas. it should be a cyan background with a one device pixel circle in the center
the circle should be red
the canvas should be rendered with device pixels
its a size of 1000x1000
my goal is that jaggies at the edges of the red circle are visible, the circle is not rendered anti-alised
and then this canvas appears in the center of the tabletop
also, the canvas renders to a size in device pixels (adjusted) so it's smaller than it would be if it were rendered to 1000 compared to 2500 tabletop dimension

keeping in mind that we are goign to add panning next, let's right now focus on the tabletop and canvas on top
let's draw this so that it's pinned to the upper left corner of the page--the edge of the viewport is the edge of the page

oh, tehre are red +s every 500 css px on the tabletop. the tabletop background is black

ok, show me what to change in the script, template, and style parts of this vue file to get us to this next waypoint

ok, so i just ran this, and it all works, except the circle is still big and fuzzy. we need to do something, the right thing, in the right place, so that the canvas renders onto device pixels on the page in tauri, not css pixels

my guess is that we do this by setting the css dimensiosn of the canvas html dom object smaller
by exactly the right amount so that each and every exact canvas pixel ends up drawing to a real and single device pixel on my retina monitor
but let's think about this task and correct patterns and simplicity to do this in the right place, the right way!

  //Keep the CSS display size in CSS pixels
  canvas.style.width  = imageSize + 'px'
  canvas.style.height = imageSize + 'px'



  ttd july, what happens when you change the monitor pixel resolution on mac? when you change the zoom 1.25 1.5 on windows??
  lots of testing out to do here now even with this little example, and even before panning

  also, what happens when the image has odd or even dimensions, and the right answer is actually a 0.5?
*/


. thinking about a wide variety of monitors from different vendors our user could have connected to their windows, mac, and raspberry pi computers, our goal here is simple: to make sure that always, every single exactly one pixel of image data gets drawn to exactly one pixel of hardware display. sure, there's CSS and smoothing and sizing and different units along the pipeline from disk to display, but our goal is to connect the disk and display pixels exactly and correctly






oh, you're going to be able to confirm that there isn't a single missing or stretched pixel by loading images that are 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4, like small paintbrush made pngs




ok so i have a mac attached to a 4k monitor from a smaller manufacturer
in Settings, Displays, there's a list

3840x2160 (these are the numbers on the 4K label)
2560x1440 (current setting that i like)
2048x1152 (bigger setting that i've tried out as part of this testing)
1920x1080 (Default)
1600x900
1152x648

there are more, but i have left Show all resolutions off

ok so our solution isn't actually good enough
i've been checking for jaggies in the red circle by taking a screenshot and then opening it in figma and zooming in
and with that text, the circle looks great

but then i started changing the resolution in settings, displays
and also holding a physical ruler up to my screen to measure the diameter of the circle
and also taking pictures zoomed into the pixels of my screen with my phone, and then looking at them zoomed in on my phone, to see individual pixels

right away i can tell that we have not achieved our goal because as i change the "resolution" in settings, the diameter of the circle on my physical screen changes!!
we need to be correctly putting canvas pixels to hardware pixels
so no matter the resolution setting, the physical ruler diameter of the circle should always be the same!!

also, i can see antialiasing on the photos of the pixels of the screen on my phone

so, let's take a step back and think about this deeply
what's the right way to really render a canvas onto hardware pixels on the user's display??



so which of these actually map to device pixels? so that one pixel for an app on my mac becomes one pixel in the hardware of my screen??










2 console; 128mm physical



nope, doesn't fucking work
you've been taking screenshots, which are correct, but fake
if this worked, you'd measure the same physical diameter to the circle even as you change the fake-ass "resolution" in mac os settings
and yet also--even as you






yes, theres' another thing, OS scale, ugh ugh ugh



import { invoke } from '@tauri-apps/api/tauri'

async function fixCanvas(canvas) {
  const dpr     = window.devicePixelRatio || 1
  const osScale = await invoke('get_os_scale') // e.g. 1.5, 2.0, etc.

  console.log(`DPR=${dpr}, OS scale=${osScale}`)

  // Compute CSS size so that
  //    1 image pixel ‚Üí 1 canvas pixel ‚Üí 1 browser backing‚Äëstore pixel
  // ‚Üí then divided by (dpr * osScale) to land on one physical pixel
  const cssSizeX = canvas.width  / (dpr * osScale)
  const cssSizeY = canvas.height / (dpr * osScale)

  canvas.style.width  = `${cssSizeX}px`
  canvas.style.height = `${cssSizeY}px`
}

and then in rust:

use tauri::{Manager, Window};

#[tauri::command]
fn get_os_scale(window: Window) -> f64 {
  // Ask the window for its current monitor
  if let Ok(Some(monitor)) = window.current_monitor() {
    // wry / winit‚Äôs `scale_factor` gives you backing-pixel-to-physical-pixel ratio
    monitor.scale_factor()
  } else {
    1.0
  }
}

fn main() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![get_os_scale])
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .expect("error while running tauri application");
}



ok but to test that this actually works, you need a square stupid black and white test pattern
alternating zebra stripes horizontal and vertical
- and then on dell and sceptre monitors
- on mac and windows
with different scales and resolutions playing in settings
a - you need to always see only black and white stripes
b - and always measure with a physical ruler the same physical size
you think you will be able to do (b) but not be able to do (a)
and if that's the case, then drop back to the solution you've got now



and confirm that at least you get 1:1 pixels on an old fashioned monitor
where the hdardware is not retina
and the os scale is 1






ok so let's say rust can get you the monitor







correct answer is 3840 √ó 2160

ok, so it's really ahrd to get the real resolution
but even if you had it, would it work?
so hard code in your real ersolution, which you know for this monitor
and fill the square with black and white stripes
and you think that it's going to look bad
and then you can abandon this trail
and if you really want true resolution using fuji, switch to 4k in settings




function fixCanvas(canvas) {//ensure the given canvas ref draws to device pixels on the screen, not css pixels

	let dpr = window.devicePixelRatio || 1//likely 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0; possible 1.3333333333333333, 1.6666666666666667, 2.25, 2.5, 3.0

	let actual = {width: 3840, height: 2160}

	let actual = 2160//maybe there is some way to get this from rust; haven't found it yet, though
	let mistake = 0//bump slightly wider like 5 or 10 to see beats

	console.log(`all from js üñ•Ô∏è ${window.devicePixelRatio} device pixel ratio, ${window.screen.height} window screen height`)

	let scale = window.screen.height / actualHeight
	console.log(`calculated manual dpr ${dpr}`)

	/*

	2160 true hardware pixels, height

	ok, so to draw a square to hit 900 pixels
	*/

	// 2) CSS size = imageSize / dpr ‚Üí 1 buffer px ‚Üí 1 device px
	canvas.style.width  = (((canvas.width * window.screen.width) / actual) + 0) + 'px'
	canvas.style.height = (((canvas.height * window.screen.height) / actual) + 0) + 'px'
}






ok, so the real pixels are a boondoggle you've spent two summer days in
you can sorta get zebra lines to stick to them, but only sorta
if it's an old school display where the pixels are one to one top to bottom, plan one behavior
if it's something else, something retina, plan a second behavior
except both of those are X by the thumbnail view and the lightbox view, also
also all those X big images and small images


simple pixels, thumbnail: render image into thumbnail size canvas
simple pixels, lightbox: render image into display size canvas

modern pixels, thumbnail: render image into thumbnail size canvas
modern pixels, lightbox: 
ok, so here, if you render image into

what if you always rendered the image into a canvas so file format pixels equaled canvas pixels
and then to zoom in and out in lightbox, you don't rerender, rather you just css position
so there you're trusting the browser stretcher to be as good or better than canvas' renderer, which is fine, you think
you're also gaining some benefit about how the looks like pixels on mac get stretched adn composited

and so all of that is fine except done that way for lots of thumbnails, you'll run out of memory
so for there, you need to use the canvas renderer





wait now chat is saying i can do true gamma in img src like this:

<svg height="0">
  <filter id="gamma">
    <feComponentTransfer>
      <feFuncR type="gamma" exponent="2.2" />
      <feFuncG type="gamma" exponent="2.2" />
      <feFuncB type="gamma" exponent="2.2" />
    </feComponentTransfer>
  </filter>
</svg>
<img src="your-image.jpg" style="filter: url(#gamma);" />



<template>
  <div>
    <svg height="0">
      <filter id="gamma">
        <feComponentTransfer>
          <feFuncR ref="gammaR" type="gamma" :exponent="gamma" />
          <feFuncG ref="gammaG" type="gamma" :exponent="gamma" />
          <feFuncB ref="gammaB" type="gamma" :exponent="gamma" />
        </feComponentTransfer>
      </filter>
    </svg>

    <img src="your-image.jpg" style="filter: url(#gamma);" />

    <button @click="increaseGamma">Increase Gamma</button>
    <button @click="resetGamma">Reset Gamma</button>
    <p>Gamma: {{ gamma.toFixed(2) }}</p>
  </div>
</template>
<script setup>
import { ref, watch } from 'vue';

const gamma = ref(2.2);
const gammaR = ref(null);
const gammaG = ref(null);
const gammaB = ref(null);

function increaseGamma() {
  gamma.value = Math.min(5.0, gamma.value + 0.2);
}

function resetGamma() {
  gamma.value = 2.2;
}

watch(gamma, (newVal) => {
  if (gammaR.value) gammaR.value.setAttribute('exponent', newVal);
  if (gammaG.value) gammaG.value.setAttribute('exponent', newVal);
  if (gammaB.value) gammaB.value.setAttribute('exponent', newVal);
});
</script>





ok, so then leaning on regular img all the way, you
-zoom by styling the regular img bigger or smaller
-do gamma with svg so there's no canvas at all

but, you can't use this for thumbnails because you'll run out of memory with all those big images
so that's what headed you to canvas--you can render into a smaller canvas, taking less memory
except if you have hundreds of those, that's still a lot of memory
and then there' sthe issue of do you still make them larger, to get under the retina, and how do those size

ok, so what if instead you either do the flipbook thumbnails, which you like, no scrolling
or, you do viewport optimization so as soon as you're done with a scroll, existing thumbnails far offscreen keep their shape but lose their image
then, you can really use img src for everything, there's no canvas at all anymore!

so then there's the minimap
which is sorta theoretical
what if it's a single canvas you squash images into
like it's cropped squares
so you can see when color change
you click on an image on the minimap, and it pages up thumbnails that surround that image
it's not exact, not one to one, not a zoom out


so here's what the application looks like, the layout of the main view, windowed

toolbar
path box
tree, with prev and next buttons for next folder that has images <--really good idea
thumbnail contact sheet, no scroll, flip back and forward through folder boundaries
minimap, squashed squares, vibes
preview 


full screen is just the lightbox view, or just the thumbnail flipbook, only
when you make the window bigger you get more thumbnails, not bigger thumbnails
the first one stays first, more or less come in after, all the page numbers and contents change
js, not layout, must decide how many images go on each row, probably?

ok so this lean forward design never shows a scrollbar
there are no memory concerns
it is easy to know what it should load ahead, just getting image tags ready

think about what could happen as the user scrolls the scroll wheel over each of these areas
over the tree view, flips through the folders - and remember there's no scroll in the tree view!
over the contact sheet, flips through pages
doesn't do anything over the minimap column
over the preview, flips through the image, maybe







on the all img tag design
your js can count how many pixels we've asked the renderer to keep in memory
this is not the byte size of the images loaded
rather it's the number of rendered pixels
and then when that gets too big, it throws away some distant ones



you want full screen lightbox, of course
and also full screen contact sheet flipbook
there needs to be a subtle visual representation when you flip over the edge of a folder




v-show display none, all vue, should be correct to make it appear, all ready, all at once

also, you can get the raster dimensions from the img tag like this
<template>
  <img ref="imgRef" :src="dataUrl" alt="Loaded image" />
</template>
<script setup>
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';
const imgRef = ref(null);
onMounted(() => {
  const img = imgRef.value;
  console.log('Raster dimensions:', img.naturalWidth, img.naturalHeight);
});
</script>





ok but you forgot the prompt to try to make something useful to you in just a few sessions!
how about
[]drag file into window, works from many paths and drives
[]roll mouse wheel to flip forward and back in that folder, uses smart ordering
[]zoom in and out of an image and drag it around in lightbox view
[]fullscreen
[]contact sheet view, does scroll, constant height, no concerns on memory
at this point, no concerns on ui, settings, speed, or memory, or image fidelity
see how good it is when coded really simple










what if the flip plan were this
if the greatest dimension of the image is the same, the zoom and viewport is the same
if not, then it returns to default placement, which is
- small images are 2x zoom, centered
- large images are fit width or height, exactly

ok so what's the fastest route to useful:
[]run from source on both mac and windows
[]drag in file to start in folder
[]list everything in that folder, confirm works on mac and windows c and usb drives
[]flip next and forward, control flip to zoom in and out
[]default ordering by correct date, with name1234 numbering that way, groups of those in sort by most recent
[]fullscreen with tauri


default placement is
