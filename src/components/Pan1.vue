ok, here im saving the dragging pointer id--all look simple correct good?

/*
watch for changes to the frame size--you need to keep the table over the frame, like dragging the upper left corner bigger

with this design as a starting point, how hard will it be to...
- during a drag, show the pointer with the os's grabbing hand?
- when the pointer is at rest above the tabletop, hiding it entirely?

grab and grabbing are a mac only thing, and look weird
ok so here's what you want
over the tabletop, pointer disappears when it falls to rest
during a drag, pointer is also off
*/

/*
ok, my work today is done, in that we've got the tabletop dragging around!

now, let's peek at what i have to do tomorrow
ill add an img tag below
the img will always be smaller than the tabletop (and the tabletop will always be larger than the screen!)
is this going to mess up anything with the clicks and drags?
my hope is that no, the html components that i put within the two divs will just stay where they are on the tabletop
even while the user pans the tabletop around
and that won't slow down gpu or negatively impact the current achievement of buttery smoothness at all!

after that, ill add a HUD--just a few lines of text that float above the tabletop and image
they'll be pinned to one corner or edge of the frame
they are just information, they should not be nor need to be clickable, selectable, anything
for instance, it might be text that shows information about the image in the lightbox
is that going to require or indicate any changes into how we've coded panning here?
my expectation and hope is no, it's not

and as to buttery smoothness, while the text may be antialiased, or on a rectangular panel that is translucent
GPUs are ready for this, so if the user flips the info hud on, they can still pan the image around below with the same experience

but let's take a step back and check now, ahead of more coding, for potential issues with this waypoint's design
looking now ahead at these two new features we'll work on tomorrow
1 image sitting on tabletop
2 hud in frame

on, in full screen mode, hide the mouse pointer entirely, likely
