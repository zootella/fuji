test this
[]mac X []windows
[]old dell monitor X []new 4k monitor
on mac, []different looks like resolutions
on windows, []different zoom numbers in settings

leaving out mac and windows set to blur the monitor to a not native resolution, though
leaving out multiple monitors, also

/*ttd august
strategy to use hard vertical
if window.devicePixelRatio is 1, then just use screen.height
if hard_vertical returns 0, <1080, or something not listed above, screen.height

ttd august, note that on a macbook air you're seeing
1710 / 1112 = 1.537 769 screen css
2560 / 1664 = 1.538 461 panel resolution
so following from the panel resolution, screen css really needs to be either
1710.769 x 1112, or
1710 x 1111.5
yeah that's better so use width, not height, when computing the scale ratio css to physical
