MVP vision, 2025aug1, goal is to be using this because it's useful in <3 more sessions
drag image into window, any folder
shows image, any format
scroll wheel flip through images in folder
zoom with persistant viewport
exit full screen and scroll through thumbnail flow

ok so what's the fastest route to useful:
code[x] mac[x] win[ ] run from source on both mac and windows
code[x] mac[x] win[ ] drag in file to start in folder
code[ ] mac[ ] win[ ] list everything in that folder, confirm works on mac and windows c and usb drives
code[ ] mac[ ] win[ ] flip next and forward, control flip to zoom in and out
code[ ] mac[ ] win[ ] default ordering by correct date, with name1234 numbering that way, groups of those in sort by most recent
code[ ] mac[ ] win[ ] fullscreen with tauri, and back again
code[ ] mac[ ] win[ ] keyboard commands



default placement is




ok, how do you quickly get to useable











/*
[]zoom with mouse wheel
[]hud
[]marble tile
[]shadows on image
[~]continuity with window move, resize, fullscreen; do that last (and, of course, you do it first. and, of course, it doesn't work and takes most of the middle of the day)
